# Battleship Project

The Battleship project is a part of my self-guided learning journey through The Odin Project's JavaScript Curriculum. This endeavor proved to be both engaging and insightful, surpassing the complexity of my earlier todo-list project. To build a solid foundation in object-oriented paradigms, I decided to delve into this book which was recommended in the curriculum, [99 Bottles of OOP](https://sandimetz.com/99bottles) by Sandi Metz. It helped me draw valuable insights about object-oriented paradigms that I applied in this project.

Crafting the ships and player classes required a thoughtful approach. I addressed issues related to attacks, board rendering, and efficiently managed the game loopâ€”all while immersing myself in the principles outlined in the book. Test-Driven Development (TDD) played a crucial role, making the process more exciting with the satisfaction of seeing all green ticks in the test cases.

A notable highlight was devising an intelligent algorithm for the AI, ensuring its gameplay closely emulates human decision-making. Although this aspect demanded more time than initially anticipated, the process was immensely rewarding and fun.

# Project

This project was made using TDD principle.

It was built using:

- JavaScript
- CSS
- Webpack
- Jest

## Key Features

- Engage in an interactive, browser-based gaming experience.
- Challenge a sophisticated AI designed to play fairly and emulate human decision patterns.
- Immerse yourself in a captivating auditory experience featuring attack sounds and invigorating battleship game music.

## Demo

You can try out a live demo of the game here: [Demo Link](https://roopxx.github.io/battleship/)
